Secret Store is a plugin for Java Enterprise Web Applications, handling the secure exchange of opaque tokens by Keycloak
OAuth offline tokens.

== About Secret Store

The project is divided into several modules. More information about the individual modules can be found in the
respective module's README files.

* secret-store: the REST backend for generating key/secret tokens backed by Keycloak Offline tokens
* secret-store-api: components that are intended to be consumed by other Java Enterprise Web Applications
* feature-pack: Generates a feature pack for Wildfly. Intended to be consumed only by the integration tests
* feature-pack-resources: Extra resources needed by the final distribution
* integration-tests: A set of integration tests
* proxy: HTTP Proxy which replaces key/secret by OAuth Tokens before forwarding the request to the target server.
* undertow-filter: Undertow Filter which replaces key/secret by OAuth tokens on incoming requests.

== Basic usage

The Secret Store has the following main components:

- Backend, protected via the Keycloak Wildfly Adapter
- Undertow Filter
- Proxy

A token is created when an user reaches the path "/secret-store/v1/tokens/create" via GET (or passing the username and
password as Basic authentication via POST) and stored into a Cassandra data store:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -u jdoe:password -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8080/secret-store/v1/tokens/create -X POST
{"key":"07579322-a915-4b1c-89b3-39b13b013193","secret":"55f32d90fd821c3d198e11ec05d896e4"}
----

If the target application is using the Undertow Filter, then the client application can start using this token as
username/password when calling the target application:
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -u jdoe:password -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8080/hawkular/accounts/personas/current
{"id":"28026b36-8fe4-4332-84c8-524e173a68bf","createdAt":"2015-12-18T14:19:13.816Z","updatedAt":"2015-12-18T14:19:13.816Z","name":"John Doe","idAsUUID":"28026b36-8fe4-4332-84c8-524e173a68bf"}

$ curl -u 07579322-a915-4b1c-89b3-39b13b013193:55f32d90fd821c3d198e11ec05d896e4 -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8080/hawkular/accounts/personas/current
{"id":"28026b36-8fe4-4332-84c8-524e173a68bf","createdAt":"2015-12-18T14:19:13.816Z","updatedAt":"2015-12-18T14:19:13.816Z","name":"John Doe","idAsUUID":"28026b36-8fe4-4332-84c8-524e173a68bf"}
----

Similarly, the client application can send the token to the target application when using the proxy. The proxy will take
care of converting the key/secret into a bearer token, so that the target application sees only this OAuth token. In the
following example, the proxy is running on localhost:8081:
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -x http://localhost:8081 -u 07579322-a915-4b1c-89b3-39b13b013193:55f32d90fd821c3d198e11ec05d896e4 -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:8080/hawkular/accounts/personas/current
{"id":"28026b36-8fe4-4332-84c8-524e173a68bf","createdAt":"2015-12-18T14:19:13.816Z","updatedAt":"2015-12-18T14:19:13.816Z","name":"John Doe","idAsUUID":"28026b36-8fe4-4332-84c8-524e173a68bf"}
----

Refer to the Backend's, Filter's and/or to the Proxy's README for more details on how to use it.

== What's this Hawkular thing I see in the code?

Hawkular is a an opensource monitoring solution sponsored by Red Hat. Originally, the Secret Store was developed to suit
the needs of that project. It was later split, so that Secret Store could be reused outside of the Hawkular context.
So, most of the references to Hawkular (and Hawkular Accounts) were stripped, but some facilities were kept, such as the
embedded Cassandra and some Cassandra-related common utilities. This does *not* mean, however, that you need Hawkular
to build, use or consume the Secret Store.

== How to build Secret Store from source

The API and backend can be build as a regular Maven project:
[source,bash]
----
$ mvn clean install
----

To build all modules, including the integration tests, use:
[source,bash]
----
$ mvn clean install -Pitest
----

== Releasing

To perform a release of Secret Store, you'll need push
permissions to the GitHub repository and execute the following:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean
mvn release:prepare release:perform
----

And accept all the default values (for versions and tags).
