= Secret Store - Examples

This module has a set of examples of how to consume the secret store.

* backend: this represents your backend, and contains a REST `EchoEndpoint`, which returns a JSON with the user's name (UUID) and the message.
* client-behind-proxy : Wraps the backend into a WAR file.
* filter-on-backend : Wraps the backend into a WAR file, adding the filter integration.
* server: an assembly of the backend in the two flavours deployed into a ready to use Wildfly server.
