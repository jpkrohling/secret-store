= Secret Store - Examples - Client behind a proxy

This module builds a WAR file with the "backend" as a library. There's no explicit integration with the Secret Store,
so, all it needs is the Keycloak configuration.

To test the proxy approach, you need to start the proxy and the Wildfly server assembled under the `server` directory.
Refer to the instructions on the `proxy` module about how to start the proxy.

Once both services are started, these are the expected responses:
