= Secret Store - Examples - Client

This module represents a client that makes REST calls to the backend service. The URL it calls is always the same,
the difference being on whether there's a proxy to be used or not.

When there's a proxy, the proxy will take care of swapping the tokens. Should a filter on the backend side be used,
no proxy is needed. Either way, the URL is the same, and the client is the same. No knowledge is required about
the backend's approach.
