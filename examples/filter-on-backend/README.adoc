= Secret Store - Examples - Filter on Backend

This module builds a WAR file with the "backend" as a library. The only interesting file on this module is the
`web.xml`, which shows how the integration with the filter is accomplished.

To test the filter approach, you can start the Wildfly server assembled in the `server` module. From there, these are
the expected responses:
