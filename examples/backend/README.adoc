= Secret Store - Examples - Backend

This module represents the backend that is to receive the calls from the client.

When there's a proxy, the proxy will take care of swapping the tokens. Should a filter on the backend side be used,
no proxy is needed. Either way, the URL is the same, and the backend business code is the same. The only difference is
in the packaging, where we add a property to web.xml in case we use the proxy.
